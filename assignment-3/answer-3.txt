1. Why do we use Derivative / Gredient to fit a target function?

Ans:It can  accelerate the speed of fitting


2. In the words 'Gredient Descent', what's the Gredient and what's the Descent?

Ans:Gredient is the derivative in the multi-dimensional space.

    Descent means that gredient always decreases,until finding a local minimum of a function.


3. What's the advantages of the 3rd gradient descent method compared to the previous methods?

Ans: The 3rd gradient descent method can always keep the  right descent direction.


4. Using the simple words to describe: What's the machine leanring.

Ans:  automatic




5.Why do we need dynamic programming? What's the difference of dynamic programming and previous talked search problme?

Ans:Some complicated problems can parse to many overlapping subproblems. In this case ,we can use dynamic programming.
    Dynamic programming often uses caching and recursion compared to search problems


6.Why do we still need dynamic programming? Why not we train a machine learning to fit a function which could get the right answer based on inputs?

Ans:1.Dynamic programming method is relatively simple.
    2.For some problems, dynamic programming method is more suitable than machine learning method.

7.Can you catch up at least 3 problems which could solved by Dynamic Programming?

Ans:1.Path Planning
    2.Editdistance
    3.Longest common subsequence

8.Can you catch up at least 3 problems wich could sloved by Edit Distance?

Ans:1,Spell checker 2.Text similarity 3.DNA sequence detection

9.Please summarize the three main features of Dynamic Programming, and make a concise explain for each feature.

Ans:1.Overlapping Subproblems 2.Overlapping computing saved in a table 3.Parse solution

10.What's the disadvantages of Dynamic Programming? (You may need search by yourself in Internet)

Ans:The main limitation to this type of coding is keeping track of previous decisions and partial choices that may be applied to a future answer.
